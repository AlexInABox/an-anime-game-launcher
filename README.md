## Flatpak support

To install the launcher via flatpak you will first have to make sure that you have flathub's remote installed

```zsh
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

After installing flathub's remote you install launcher.moe's remote

```zsh
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists launcher.moe https://gol.launcher.moe/gol.launcher.moe.flatpakrepo
```

Now the only thing remaining is to install the launcher

```zsh
flatpak install launcher.moe com.gitlab.KRypt0n_.an-anime-game-launcher
```

Some additional configuration is possible when using the flatpak. For info about this, see [this page](https://gitlab.com/lane__/an-anime-game-launcher-flatpak/-/blob/master/README.md)

## Chinese version

To use Chinese version of the game make sure that you have

```yaml
server: cn
```

field in your `config.yaml` file (settings -> launcher folder). If your system uses the Chinese language - then it should be selected automatically. If not, then close the launcher, replace `server: global` with `server: cn`, and run it again. After that launcher will download the Chinese version of the game and the patch
