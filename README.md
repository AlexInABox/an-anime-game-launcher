> Now I'm working on moving the project to the Tauri. Also for some personal reasons I, like the patch's author, will be busy, but until Christmas, so it's a bit more than a month. I will make some critical updates if they will be required, but the development will be frozen for this period. I hope you will enjoy playing the game, and I will enjoy continuing the development of this project

> And, by the way, @Maroxy helped me to create the discord server for this project. I will sometimes appear there and you will be able to ask me about something if you want, ehe
