## IMPORTANT: ##
# NFAA must be installed separately, it's not included in the crosire/reshade-shaders repository.
# If any of the shaders below do not exist, you will get a blank screen when launching the game.
# vkBasalt does not have fancy error handling, so you will have to launch from a terminal and look for error lines like "vkBasalt err: failed to load shader file".

# Setting HDRPower higher makes dark things darker.

# The difference between radius1 and radius2 decides the peak brightness.
